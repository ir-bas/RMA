        <h4>Expected results from the project</h4>
        <p>In accordance with the objectives of the project and with the implementation of the work program, the expected results are:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preparation of a report of the following results: study of European and world achievements in the application of mathematical methods for processing and analysis of cardiac data registered before, during and after a stressful situation.</li>
            <li>Acquiring new knowledge about the influence of stress on the fractal properties of HRV, such as: self-similarity, fractal dimension, Hurst effect, spectral density. Comparative evaluation and classification of the used nonlinear methods for determining the fractal and multifractal properties of the HRV. Search for dependence between the parameters of the mathematical methods used and the influence of stress.</li>
            <li>Preparation of 8 scientific publications, of which at least 4 indexed or with SJR rank and 1 with an impact factor:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>4 publications in international scientific journals;</li>
                <li>4 publications in national or international scientific conferences, published in the materials of the conferences.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Creation of the WEB site of the project with the goals and tasks, information about the team, upcoming events and achieved results.</li>
            
        </ol>  



        <h4>Increasing the research capacity of the applying organizations, as well as improving team members qualification</h4>

        <p>The presented project proposal envisages continued work of the scientific team in the field of the mathematical analysis of HRV, based on the latest world achievements in this direction. Despite the widespread use in recent years of HRV as an informative and inexpensive method for monitoring the cardiological condition of the studied subjects, the problem of correct interpretation of the results remains relevant.</p>
        <p>The future development of the scientific team will follow the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creation of algorithms for the analysis of cardiac data by using various mathematical methods.</li>
            <li>Search for scientific connections between the influence of various stressful conditions and HRV.</li>
            <li>Development of software tools for proven scientific methods for computer-based analysis of HRV, which would enable automation of the analysis process.</li>
            <li>Regular publication of the achieved results in specialized scientific journals with an impact factor (or SJR rank) or indexed by Scopus, Web of Science, as well as in the scientific volumes of national and international conferences.</li>
            <li>Assistance in the preparation of a doctoral thesis of a member of the team.</li>
        </ol>
