         <h4>Project management plan </h4>
         <p>The project team will be responsible for the implementation of the project activities. The project activities are distributed among the members of the scientific team as follows:
             
         <ol>
             <li>Assistant Professor, Ph.D. Penio Dimitrov Lebamovski, IR-BAS - project leader. <br> <u>Scientific tasks </u>– Coordination of scientific research and create a 3D extreme game model. Development of algorithms to create the game. Development of a methodology for determining the fractal properties of cardiac signals registered in different stressful situations. Organization of the publication activity.</li> <br>
             <li>Assistant Professor, Ph.D. Krasimir Yordanov Cheshmedzhiev, IR-BAS-specialist.<br> <u>Scientific tasks </u>– Algorithmization of graphic and wavelet methods for the analysis of HRV before and after a stressful situation. Assessment of the impact of stress on HRV and statistical processing of the obtained results. Publishing activity.</li>
             <br><li>Assistant Professor, Ph.D. Miroslav Trifonov Dechev, IR-BAS-specialist <br> <u>Scientific tasks </u>– Due to his less scientific experience (only 9 months), this postdoctoral fellow together with the project manager will take part in the development of algorithms for creating a 3D game, as well as in the organization of 2 scientific seminars. Publishing activity.</li>
             <br><li>Ekaterina Popovska-Slavova, part-time doctoral student at IR-BAS. <br> <u>Scientific tasks </u>– The dissertation work of the doctoral student has a direct connection with the present project proposal, as part of the mathematical apparatus that she uses in the analysis of economic data will be used. She will carry out a study of possible connections between the fractal (multifractal) properties of the HRV and the influence of stressful situations during training of athletes and as a result of a 3D game. Comparative analysis of the obtained results. Publishing activity.</li>
             <br><li>Yoan-Alexander Bogdanov Tsanev, student at the Technical University, Varna. <br> <u>Scientific tasks </u>– Creation and maintenance of a WEB site for the project. Assistance in the statistical processing of the data and organization of 2 scientific seminars.</li>
